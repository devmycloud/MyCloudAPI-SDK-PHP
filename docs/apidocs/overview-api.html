		<h1>API Overview</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API is a RESTful API. It is built on top of the
			HTTP protocol to implement communications with the API server.
		</p>

		<h2>API Requests</h2>
		<p>
			API requests send their data using the multipart/form-data
			specification defined by
			<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388">RFC2388</a>,
			which is the same standard that web browsers use to submit
			form data when you submit an HTML &lt;FORM&gt;. This standard
			was chosen because it is supported by virtually every modern
			programming language, and has many online tools for simulating
			requests with the data format.
		</p>

		<h2>API Responses</h2>
		<p>
			API responses send their data using the JSON
			(JavaScript Object Notation) standard defined by
			<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC7159</a>.
			This standard was chosen because it is inherently suitable
			to represent object structures, is supported by virtually
			every modern programming language, and it easily read in
			it's native form.
		</p>

		<h2>PATCH Verb Special Case</h2>
		<p>
			Standard HTTP defines PUT and PATCH verbs. Specifically,
			PATCH is used to <em>update</em> a model (database record).
			The MyCloud API attempts to stick to the RESTful standard
			as much as possible. Unfortunately, the platform that the
			API was developed on is not capable of properly handling
			the data submitted by the PATCH verb. 
			Because of this limitation, all PATCH
			requests must actually use the POST verb, and set a special
			parameter named "_method" with the value "PATCH". This special
			parameter is interpretted by the API platform, which then
			properly routes the request to the code that handles the
			PATCH verb processing

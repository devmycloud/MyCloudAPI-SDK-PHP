		<h1>PHP SDK Overview</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API PHP SDK provides a complete PHP implementation of
			the client side the API. With the PHP SDK, you do not need to worry
			about any of the low level details of programming with the API.
			Connectivity, authentication, model objects, logging, and other
			supporting code is all provided for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			When working with the PHP SDK, you will work primarily with the
			API model objects. Model objects provide everything you need to
			work with any data related to your shop, as well as implement
			all of the calls to the API server needed to create, get and
			update that data.
		</p>

		<h2>Model Objects</h2>
		<p>
			All model objects in the PHP SDK are standard PHP classes and
			class objects. You can work with them the same as you would
			with any PHP class and object.
		</p>
		<p>
			All model objects are contained in the PHP namespace
			<code>MyCloud\Api\Model</code>. For convenience and to simplify
			your code, you can add PHP <em>use</em> statements at the top
			of your code as in:
			<pre>
 use MyCloud\Api\Model\Customer;
 use MyCloud\Api\Model\Order;
 use MyCloud\Api\Model\Product;</pre>
			This will allow you to refer to the object classes directly
			without specifying the namespace, as in:
			<pre>
 $order = new Order();
 $customer_list = Customer::all();</pre>

		<h2>Model Attributes</h2>
		<p>
			The model objects provide <em>attributes</em>. These attributes
			use the PHP <em>magic</em> getter/setter paradigm. This means
			that in general you can work with the attributes as object fields.
			Furthermore, for each attribute the class will provide a getter
			and setter method call.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, the Customer model has a <em>name</em> attribute.
			Thus, you can access the value of the customer name with either
			of these programming constructs:
			<pre>
 $name = $customer->name;
 $name = $customer->getName();
 $customer->name = $name;
 $customer->setName( $name );</pre>
		</p>

		<h2>API Requests</h2>
		<p>
			API requests typically return model objects. You can then work
			with the objects the same as any PHP object. However, there are
			two cases where a model is not returned: errors and exceptions.
		</p>
		<p>
			If an error occurs in an API request that does not cause the
			API to fail processing the request, you will get back an
			<strong>MCError</strong> object instead of a model object.
			Thus, for every API call that you make that expects an object
			to be returned, you must first check to see if that object is
			an instance of class MCError. If it is, the object will contain
			information regarding the error that occurred.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of handling both of these cases would look similar
			to this:
		</p>
			<pre>
try {
	$product = Product::get( $product_id );

	if ( $product instanceof MCError ) {
		print "ERROR retrieving Product:" . PHP_EOL;
		print "      " . $product-&gt;getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
	} else {
		print_product_data( "Product: ", $product );
	}
} catch ( Exception $ex ) {
	print "EXCEPTION: " . $ex-&gt;getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
</pre>
		<p>
			You can see that we first check to see if the returned
			object is an <em>instanceof</em> <strong>MCError</strong>.
			If it is not, then the object returned is one of the API
			models ready for you to use. We also wrap every SDK call
			inside of a <code>try { ... } catch ( Exception $ex ) { ... }</code>
			to make sure we catch any exceptions that may be thrown
			by the SDK code. Exceptions will contain further information
			about the error, which you can obtain with the getMessage()
			function.

		<h1>API Overview</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API is a RESTful API providing access to your MyCloud
			shop and the data associated with your shop. The current release
			of the API does not implement access to every element of your shop.
			It is designedprimarily to facilitate managing your customer, products
			and orders. Future releases of the API will continue to add more
			functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			The API is implemented using standard HTTP connectivity and standard
			HTTP protocols. Therefore, you should be able to connect to and use
			the API using any language with support for HTTP and it's related
			standards. The MyCloud API PHP SDK is provided to assist those who
			are developing their applications using PHP. With this SDK, all of
			the low-level work involving setting up connections, making requests,
			encoding and decoding objects, and handling errors is provided for
			you. With the PHP SDK, you can make simple calls with pre-defined
			models to work with the API.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please refer to the <a href="index.html">API Index</a> to navigate
			all of the documentation related to the API. You will also find
			documentation related to the PHP SDK there.

		<h1>Protocol</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API is a RESTful API implemented using the HTTP protocol.
			Over the HTTP protocol, a communication protocol is utilized to 
			exchange the data necessary to fulfill any API request. The protocol
			uses two separate standards to implement the data exchange:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Upstream:</strong> multipart/form-data<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Downstream:</strong> JSON<br/>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Upstream</h2>
		<p>
			The upstream data is the data sent from the API client to the
			API server. This data is exchanged using the
			'multipart/form-data' standard defined by
			<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578">RFC7578</a>.
			This is the standard data format that is used by web browsers
			to submit data from a &lt;form&gt; on a webpage. The format
			is support by most modern programming languages, and provides
			support for sending files as well as fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are using the PHP SDK, you will not have to deal
			with the upstream data. The SDK handles all of the data
			conversions for you. You will work with the model classes
			provided by the SDK, and the SDK will create the
			multipart/form-data data that will be sent to the server
			for you.
		</p>

		<h2>Downstream</h2>
		<p>
			The downstream data is the data that is sent from the API
			server to the API client. This data is exchanged using the
			JSON standard defined by
			<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC7159</a>.
			This is JavaScript Object Notation, which is supported
			by most modern programming languages, specifically JavaScript.
			JSON provides a very convenient format for encoding object
			data, which makes it well suited for exhanging object models.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are using the PHP SDK, you will not have to deal
			with the downstream data. The SDK handles all of the data
			conversions for you. The SDK will read all of the JSON data
			sent from the API server, and convert that into the model
			objects for you.

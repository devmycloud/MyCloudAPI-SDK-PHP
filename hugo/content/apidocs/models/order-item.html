<h1>Order Item Model</h1>
<p>
	The Order Item model represents a product that is an item on
	an order for your shop. For each product that is part of an
	order, there will be an order item. In other words, order items
	<em>connect</em> products to orders. Furthermore, an order item
	also defines the quantity of the product being ordered, as well
	as the actual price the product is being sold for on that order.
</p>
<p>
	Using OrderItems can be a little confusing at first. You need to
	understand that OrderItems attached to an Order that you have
	retrieved from the API are <em>complete</em> objects and have
	all of their fields setup properly, including a complete Product
	object. On the other hand, when you are creating a new order,
	or updating an existing order, the OrderItem does not need a
	complete Product object to function properly - it only needs
	the order item's id for updating the price or quantity, and it
	only needs a Product object with an id when creating a new
	order item. Please see the example code provided for more details.

		<h1>API Overview</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API is a RESTful API. It is built on top of the
			HTTP protocol to implement communications with the API server.
		</p>

		<h2>API Requests</h2>
		<p>
			Client API requests send their data to the API server
			using the multipart/form-data specification defined by
			<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578">RFC7578</a>,
			which is the same standard that web browsers use to submit
			form data when you submit an HTML &lt;FORM&gt; using the
			'multipart/form-data' enctype. This standard
			was chosen because it is supported by virtually every modern
			programming language, and has many online tools for simulating
			requests with the data format.
		</p>

		<h2>API Responses</h2>
		<p>
			The API server responses send their data to the client
			using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) standard defined
			by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC7159</a>.
			This standard was chosen because it is inherently suitable
			to represent object structures, is supported by virtually
			every modern programming language, and it easily read in
			it's native form by the developer.
		</p>

		<h2>API Data Encoding</h2>
		<p>
			The MyCloud database, and thus the API, utilizes UTF8
			encoding for all data that is not ASCII data.
		</p>
		<p>
			For all data used with the MyCloud API,
			UTF8 encoding should be used for any data that
			is not contained within the ASCII dataset. In other words, if
			your data contains Thai script, that data should be encoded
			with UTF8. In general, you should not need to do anything
			special to make this work. If you are editing code that
			contains Thai script, your editor most likely uses UTF8 to
			store the program file. Most of the tools that you are using
			to access, manipulate, and display data use UTF8.

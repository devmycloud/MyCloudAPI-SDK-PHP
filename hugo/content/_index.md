The MyCloud API PHP SDK is provided to MyCloud clients to give them
an easy SDK to develop code in-house to access their account information
using PHP code.

The MyCloud API is a RESTful API that can support access using any
language you code with. However, since most of South East Asia, and
Thailand specifically, codes using PHP, we have provided a pre-built
PHP SDK to allow you to begin coding with the MyCloud API in minutes.

The MyCloud API is maintained on <a href="">GitHub</a> for your
convenience. We will selectively accept pull requests from clients who have
found bugs in the code. Or you may submit patch diffs directly
to <a href="mailto:dev@mycloudfulfillment.com">dev@mycloudfulfillment.com</a>.

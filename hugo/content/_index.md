The MyCloud API PHP SDK is provided to MyCloud clients to give them
an easy SDK to develop code in-house to access their account information
using PHP code.

The MyCloud API is a RESTful API that can support access using any
language you code with. However, since most of South East Asia, and
Thailand specifically, codes using PHP, we have provided a pre-built
PHP SDK to allow you to begin coding with the MyCloud API in minutes.

The <a href="https://github.com/devmycloud/MyCloudAPI-SDK-PHP"
>MyCloud API is maintained on GitHub</a> for your
convenience. We will selectively accept pull requests from clients who have
found bugs in the code. Or you may submit patch diffs directly
to <a href="mailto:dev@mycloudfulfillment.com">dev@mycloudfulfillment.com</a>.

The MyCloud API Documentation now has an official project that stands apart from the
SDK project. This new documentation includes the HTTP API protocol details needed
to implement an API client in any programming langauge, as well as the most recent
PHP SDK documentation. Therefore, the documentation under this project should
<em><strong>not</strong></em> be considered as the most up-to-date documentation.

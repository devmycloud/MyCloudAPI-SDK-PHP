		<h1>Authentication</h1>
		<p>
			The MyCloud API uses
			<a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>
			for authetication. This stateless authentication protocol
			is becoming a popular standard for API's for many good
			technical reasons. Here at MyCloud, we chose JWT because
			it is straighforward to implement, requires very little
			overhead, has libraries available in almost every popular
			programming language, and eliminates the need for state
			(such as sessions and cookies), which means that it can
			scale better.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are using the PHP SDK, you do not need to worry
			about JWT. All of the authentication is handled for you
			by the SDK. All you need to do is configure your API
			keys, and you are all set to beging using the API.
		</p>
		<p>
			The JWT authentication is <em>token based</em>, which
			means that the API never sends user logins or passwords
			within the protocol. Your account is provided with an
			apiKey and a secretKey, which are exchanged in the 
			protocol. Tokens expire after a reasonble period
			(currently 8 hours), after which they must be refreshed.
			This allows MyCloud to expire or invalidate keys that
			are known to be compromised, without needing to modify
			your account login credentials. If your tokens are
			ever compromised, we simply issue new tokens for your
			account. You can then login to get the new keys, add
			them to your configuration, and continue working with
			the API.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you make requests with the API, you will set
			the 'Authentication' header, with a 'Bearer '
			specification that includes your JWT token. This
			token is then verified against the token list on the
			server to authenticate your request.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not have a token, or the token you are using
			has expired, then you will need to request a new token.
			The API exposes a POST request named '/gettoken' to get
			a new token to continue using the API. The request takes
			two parameters: apikey, secretKey. With this request,
			a JWT token will be returned to you, which you will then
			used in the 'Authentication' header for every other API
			request that you make.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are using the PHP SDK, you never need to worry
			about any of the authentication protocols. You will
			configure your API keys in the sdk_config.ini 
			configuration file used by your program, and the SDK
			will handle everything for you.
